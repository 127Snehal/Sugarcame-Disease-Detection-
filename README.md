# Sugarcame-Disease-Detection-
Web Application for Sugarcane Disease Detection 


Sugarcane disease is a major challenge for the sugar industry in Maharastra, often leading to
significant crop destruction and financial losses. Early detection and treatment of these diseases are
crucial, but farmers may lack the expertise to identify them. This study explores the use of machine
learning, specifically image processing and deep learning techniques (CNN), as a potential solution
to this problem. By training a deep learning model on a dataset of disease-infected sugarcane images,
the study successfully develops a model capable of detecting and classifying sugarcane diseases. This
research offers a promising approach to assist farmers in detecting and classifying sugarcane diseases
using deep learning algorithms.
